# Bike Rental Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of weather conditions and special events on bike rental patterns. 
Using data from bike rental systems and weather reports, we analyze how different weather conditions
and events like the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D.C. affect the number of bike rentals.

## Data Sources
- `day.csv`: Daily bike rental data including weather conditions and the total number of rentals.
- `cherry-blossoms_filtered_2011-2013.csv`: Data about the Cherry Blossom Festival dates and durations.

## Analysis
- **Weather Impact**: We analyze the influence of temperature, humidity, windspeed, and weather conditions on bike rentals.
- **Event Impact**: We study the changes in bike rental patterns during, before, and after the Cherry Blossom Festival.

## Files
- `finalproject.Rmd`: Contains all the R scripts for loading, processing, and analyzing the data.
- `Plots/`: Directory containing visualizations generated from the analysis.

## How to Run
1. Load the `finalproject.Rmd` script in RStudio.
2. Run the script to perform data analysis and generate plots.

## Requirements
- R and RStudio
- Required R packages: `dplyr`, `readr`, `ggplot2`, `randomForest`, `caret`

## Conclusion
The findings of this analysis provide insights into how external factors influence bike rental demand, 
which can assist in strategic planning and operational adjustments for bike rental services.
