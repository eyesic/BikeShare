## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
hour <-read_csv("/Users/lillyrepak/Desktop/STOR 320/hour.csv")
day <-read_csv("/Users/lillyrepak/Desktop/STOR 320/day.csv")
```

```{r}
new_day <- day %>%
  mutate(true_weekday = weekday %in% c(1,2,3,4,5)) 
new_season_labels <- c("1" = "Winter", "2" = "Spring", "3" = "Summer", "4" = "Fall")
ggplot(new_day) +
geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x = true_weekday, y = cnt, fill = season), show.legend = F) +
  facet_grid(~ season, labeller = labeller(season = new_season_labels)) +
  xlab("Was It a Weekday?") +
  ylab("Count") 
```

```{r}
new_workday_labels <- c("0" = "Not A Workday", "1" = "A Workday") 
ggplot(day) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x= cnt, y = temp), color = "lightBlue") +
  facet_wrap(~workingday, labeller = labeller(workingday = new_workday_labels)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x= cnt, y = temp), method = "lm") +
  xlab("Count") +
  ylab("Temperature") 
```
